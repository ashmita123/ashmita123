### About Me

I’m a Computer Science graduate from the University at Buffalo, focused on building scalable systems at the intersection of AI and blockchain. Currently at Dapi, I’m working on TaskNet — a secure, decentralized infrastructure for browser-based AI agents.

I’ve contributed to:
- Cryptographic systems with **zk-SNARKs**, **zkTLS**, and **TEE attestation**
- Full-stack apps across **React, Django, Node**, and **Solidity**
- Research projects around **data provenance** and **adversarial AI**

Previously a national grant awardee in Nepal and a NASA SpaceApps Challenge judge.
